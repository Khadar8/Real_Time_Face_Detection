Face Detection App
This web-based Face Detection application uses the face-api.js library to perform real-time face detection, age and gender prediction, and facial landmarks and expressions detection. The app allows users to start and stop the camera feed, capture an image, and display the detected face along with face landmarks, expressions, and other relevant information.

Features
Real-time Face Detection: Detect faces from the live camera feed.

Age and Gender Prediction: Predict the age and gender of the detected faces.

Facial Landmarks: Show the landmarks for each detected face (eyes, nose, mouth, etc.).

Facial Expressions: Display facial expressions such as happy, sad, surprised, etc.

Capture Image: Capture an image of the detected face along with the detection lines and store it.

Responsive Layout: The page is scrollable, and captured images are shown below the camera feed.

Technologies Used
HTML: For creating the structure of the web page.

CSS: For styling and layout of the page.

JavaScript: For implementing the camera functionality and face detection logic using face-api.js.

face-api.js: A JavaScript library that provides pre-trained models for face detection, age and gender prediction, facial landmarks, and expressions.

Setup and Installation
To run this app locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

A local web server for serving the HTML files. You can use:

Live Server extension for VS Code.

Alternatively, you can use any server like http-server in Node.js or python -m SimpleHTTPServer if you're using Python.

Steps
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-detection-app.git
cd face-detection-app
Open the folder in your code editor (e.g., VS Code).

Install the required models from face-api.js by downloading them into the models directory. You can find the models here:

Tiny Face Detector

Face Landmarks 68 Net

Face Recognition Net

Age and Gender Net

Download and place them in the models folder of the project.

Start the local server:

If you're using VS Code, right-click index.html and choose "Open with Live Server."

Or use a different local server method.

Open index.html in your browser.

Running the Application
Start the camera: Click the "Start Camera" button to activate the camera and begin real-time face detection.

Stop the camera: Click the "Stop Camera" button to stop the camera feed.

Capture Image: Click the "Capture Image" button to capture the current frame along with detection lines. The captured image will appear below the video.
